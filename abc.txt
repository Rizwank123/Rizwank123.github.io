Chef's Recipe

Chef Gusteau is one of the finest chefs in Paris. Let's understand how he cooks!

Chef's Ingredients

 The chef receives exactly 1 ingredient per day from the market. The ingredients never repeat.

 Every Ingredient belongs to 1 of the 5 categories

namely Fiber, Fat, Carb, Protein & Seasoning

• Every Ingredient has a unique ingredient ID. The ingredient ID always starts with the category name (ex: FiberBroccoli FatOil, CarbRice)

• Every category of ingredient has an expiry. The number of days an ingredient can be used is provided in the below list: o Fat - 1 (.e. Fat ingredients received on Day 1 can be used on Day 1 or Day 2, but expires if not used by Day 2)

。 Carb - 2 (l.e. Carb ingredients received on Day 1 can be used on Day 1, Day 2 or Day 3, but expires if not used by Day 3)

• Protein - 3
•Fiber - 3
• Seasoning - 4

Chef's Dishes

• All of the chef's dishes have exactly 3 ingredients.

 All the Ingredients used will be fully used in a dish. The chef

doesn't use some part/quantity of an ingredient.

All of the chef's dishes must have at least 2 of the ingredients from a single category. (l.e. At least 2 Fat ingredients OR at least 2 Fiber ingredients OR at least 2 Carb Ingredients OR at least 2 Protein ingredients OR at least 2 Seasoning ingredients)
Chef's Cooking Style

If the chef has multiple options of ingredients for the dish, then he takes the oldest possible ones to cook in the order of their arrival.

After the chef prepares a dish, the ingredients used can NOT

be re-used as they've been already used.

 The chef prepares a maximum of 1 dish per day.

 If the chef doesn't have enough ingredients to cook the dish with the above-mentioned rules, then he doesn't cook on that day.

Given the input array of Ingredient id that the chef receives every day (l.e. array Index is the day number) write a program to print when does the chef cook a dish and when he doesn't.
Input

Line 1: The total number of days for the scope of the problem (1 <= Input <= 20)

Line 2: The space-separated ingredient ids. (6 <=

length(ingredientid) <= 20)

Output

Print the ":" separated used ingredient ids in order of their arrival if the chef cooks on that day and print "#" if the chef doesn't cook anything on that day. Print the output as a single string. NOTE: Please focus on submitting a working solution. We are

not looking for optimization in this round. Please feel

comfortable to use brute-force.
Sample Test Case 1

Input:
5
Fatoil FiberSpinach CarbRice FatCheese FiberBeans

Fatoll is usable only on day 1 or day 2, it expires today

and won't be available for the next day.
